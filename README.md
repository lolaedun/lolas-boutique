## Lola's Boutique
{{IMAGE COMING SOON...}}

Welcome to my online boutique where I have mindfulness inspired products available to buy. This ecommerce store was built using Django and Python, deployed on Heroku.

This website provides full CRUD functionality to the admin user to add and delete products from the purposely built admin panel. Customers are able to view a history of all orders placed from their profile login.

### **Design Choices**
### Colours Mood board and Mockups
I have used [ColourLovers](https://www.colourlovers.com/palettes) to find inspiration for my colour palette and scheme. I went for simple muted colours to not distract from the products on display.

##### FONT CHOICE
  I chose to use a simple **Lato** font for this website to keep things simple and legible.

##### ICONS

A Favicon was added to the site. I designed the initials LB using lato font and sticking to muted colours of black and white.

##### LOGO
I have created a simple logo using **Lato** font in bold and normal to represent the purpose of the website using Canva and to maintain the consistency of fonts used throughout the site.
