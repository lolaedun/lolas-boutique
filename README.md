## Lola's Boutique
{{IMAGE COMING SOON...}}

Welcome to my online boutique where I have mindfulness inspired products available to buy. This ecommerce store was built using Django and Python, deployed on Heroku.

This website provides full CRUD functionality to the admin user to add and delete products from the purposely built admin panel. Customers are able to view a history of all orders placed from their profile login.
